When delivery occurs between 20 and 37 weeks of pregnancy, it's called a preterm birth. A baby born early is called preterm (or premature). Preterm babies are sometimes called \"preemies.\"\r\n\r\nMultiple pregnancies rarely last for the usual 40 weeks. For twins, the average time to delivery is 35 weeks. For triplets, the average time is 32 weeks. For quadruplets, the average time is 30 weeks.[footnote 1](document/aa100355/aa100355-Bib) The earlier babies are born, the greater their risk of health problems.\r\n\r\nWhen babies are born too early, their major organs aren't fully formed. As a result, preterm infants may not be able to eat, breathe, or stay warm on their own. They may also have jaundice, infection, or anemia.\r\n\r\nAfter delivery, the neonatal staff will check and take care of your preterm babies. If your babies' [gestational age](document/tn5878/tn5878-sec) is less than 36 weeks, your babies may be moved to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for specialized care. You will be able to visit your babies. The obstetric staff will care for you."
