The way people live and think may disturb their natural energy, and they may become ill. The aim of healing touch is to focus (or channel) healing energy to restore natural health.\r\n\r\nPractitioners of healing touch believe they can use their hands to change a person's energy flow and restore health. During a session, the practitioner moves his or her hands several inches above the person's body, often making sweeping hand motions. The practitioner also may place his or her hands lightly on specific parts of the person's body."

The practice is difficult to study using scientific methods."

Your doctor can help you manage your health better if he or she knows about all of your health practices."
