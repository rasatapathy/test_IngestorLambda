The pain may spread when a tender point is pressed and causes pain in a larger area (for example, down the leg, arm, or back).\r\n\r\nThere are 9 pairs of tender points. Each pair has one point on each side of the body, for a total of 18 points. These pairs are located:\r\n\r\n- At the back of the neck behind the ear, where the neck muscles attach to the base of the skull.\r\n- About halfway between the base of the neck and the tip of the shoulder.\r\n- At the spot where the back muscles attach to the shoulder blade.\r\n- On the front of the neck above the collarbone.\r\n- Just to the right and left of the breastbone (sternum) about 2 in. (5 cm) below the collarbone.\r\n- On each forearm just below and to the outside of the crease of the elbow.\r\n- Just above and to the outside of each buttock.\r\n- On the outer upper leg just behind the bony part of the hip (this point is easier to find when standing).\r\n- On the inside of each knee.\r\n\r\nExperts call these tender points, but you may also hear them called trigger points."
